Hello!

I am Wafi Syed, a middle schooler who loves to code.

This is one of my first projects that I am actively still working on with teachers and myself of course.

Big thanks to my Uncle, Ayleya Raza, and my computer science teachers Raza Ali, and Aafaq Abidi for helping me out on this project!
